In this project, I coded a Python program that can manage the inventory of a shoe store. The program can perform various tasks such as reading data from a text file, capturing new data from the user, viewing all the data in a table format, searching for a specific shoe by its code, calculating the value of each shoe item, and updating the quantity of the shoes that need to be restocked. The program uses a class named Shoes to represent each shoe item, and a list of Shoes objects to store the inventory data. The program also uses functions to implement the logic for each task, and a menu to allow the user to choose the desired option. The program handles errors using try-except blocks, and uses the tabulate module to format the output. The program demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, file handling, data structures, and user interface design
